Software
1)Can turn on external DACs
2)Can turn on internal DACs
3)Can toggle switches
4)LCD functional
5)Change Frequencies (not perfectly for Ch3&4 because of interrupt delay)
6)change waveform shape
7)measure interrupt time of TIM9&10 to add into account (~9.4us)
8)update LCD
   -when function is turned on or off
   -for shape change
   -for freq change
   -for switches

TODO - software
5)square waves with varying duty cycle







Hardware
1)Have external DACs with LPF to smooth
2)switches work
3) UART chip with clock from uC


TODO - hardware
1) remove DC from external DACs
2) refine DC blocker for internal DACs
3) add smoothing LPF for internal DACs
4) summing amps for Ch1 & 2 w/ DC
5) summing amp w/DC for multitone channel
7) voltage regulator
