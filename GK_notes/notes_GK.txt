ASKED Questions

NOT ASKED
11) Do I have to add DAC to activate_project.sh manually?
2) There should be separate defines for each sub-arch: z.B., Architecture_STM32L1xx and Architecture_STM32L152RC for uC-specific things like gpio banks or more periphs.

Need to finish
2) mutex thing not working
3) Config struct not right


Recent thought processes
- don't use TTC_Timer for example. Start with STD_Periph and use directly.
- get proximity sensor working
- UART
- finish gpio transition
