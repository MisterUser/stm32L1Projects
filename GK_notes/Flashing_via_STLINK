1. Connect STLINK & uC
  On STLINK side (SWD header)
    - Pin 1 -> VDD of external uC -> Connect to same as on uC side
    - Pin 2 -> SWCLK
    - Pin 3 -> GND                -> Connect to same as on uC side
    - Pin 4 -> SWDIO
    don't need to connect pins 5&6
    - Pin 5 -> NRST (OPTIONAL)
    - Pin 6 -> SWO (RESERVED)
    
  On uC side
    - PA13 -> SWDIO
    - PA14 -> SWCLK
    
2. NRST has an internal PULLUP which keeps it high
   BOOT0 should be low
   BOOT1 should be high or don't care

3. Remove ST-Link header jumpers (CN3)

3. To program:
   - Windows: STM32 ST-LINK Utility
      
   - Linux: st-util flash or debug
