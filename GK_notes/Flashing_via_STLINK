1. Connect STLINK & uC
  On STLINK side (SWD header)
    - Pin 1 -> VDD of external uC -> Connect to same as on uC side
    - Pin 2 -> SWCLK
    - Pin 3 -> GND                -> Connect to same as on uC side
    - Pin 4 -> SWDIO
    don't need to connect pins 5&6
    - Pin 5 -> NRST (OPTIONAL)
    - Pin 6 -> SWO (RESERVED)
    
  On uC side
    - PA13 -> SWDIO
    - PA14 -> SWCLK
    
2. NRST has an internal PULLUP which keeps it high
   BOOT0 should be low (can be grounded)
   BOOT1 should be high or don't care (leave it floating, especially if BOOT0 is grounded)

3. Remove ST-Link header jumpers (CN3)

3. To program:
   - Windows: STM32 ST-LINK Utility
      1. Target->Connect (This lets you know device is functioning at all/has power/and JTAGs connected)
      2. get bin from .elf via:
          arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary src.elf src.bin
      3. Open file in ST-LINK Util, then Target->Program...
      
   - Linux: st-util flash or debug
      1. start st-util
      2. gdb.sh or flash_stlinkv2.sh
